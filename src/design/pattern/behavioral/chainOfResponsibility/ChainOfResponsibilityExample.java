/*ðŸ¤” Why Use Chain of Responsibility Pattern?
âœ… Decouples request senders and receivers â†’ Client doesnâ€™t need to know who handles the request.
âœ… Flexible and scalable â†’ You can add new handlers (e.g., HR approval) without modifying existing code.
âœ… Avoids if-else clutter â†’ No giant if-else chains in the code.
